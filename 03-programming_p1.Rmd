# Basic R Programming (Part I) {#programming1}

Today we are going to learn some basic programming concepts. By the end of the session, you should be able to:

-   Run and troubleshoot commands in the R console.

-   Write comments to your code to better structure it.

-   Understand the different data types and when they are used.

-   Create and use variables.

-   Load R packages and use their functions.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(webexercises)

```

### Activity 1: Set up your Working Directory

It's good practice to set your working directory when you first open RStudio. Remember that the working directory is the location where we want to store any resulting data files or scripts that you'll work on in this session. Last week I showed you how to do this using [a button-and-click interface](#set_wd).

Using those instructions, create a folder called "Week2" in the `rintro` project folder and set it as your working directory. Once you have done that, check to make sure it is your working directory (i.e., type `getwd()` into the console). Your should see something similar to this.

```{r eval = F}

> setwd("C:/Users/0131045s/Desktop/Programming/R/Workshops/Example/Rintro_2024/week2")

```

## Using the Console

In the previous chapter, I made a distinction between the script and the console. I said that the script was an environment where we would write and run polished code, and the R console is an environment for writing and running "dirty" quick code to test ideas, or code that we would run one.

That distinction is kinda true, but it's not completely true. In reality, when we write a script we are preparing ***commands*** for R to ***execute*** in the console. In this sense, the R script is equivalent to a waiter. We tell the waiter (script) what we want to order, and then the waiter hands that order to the chef (console).

Even though we will mostly use R scripts in these classes, it's important to know how to work the R console. We don't want our waiter to spit into our food.

### Typing Commands in the Console

The R console uses the operator "\>" to indicate that it is ready for a new command. We enter in our code after this operator and press enter to compute it.

We can command the R console to compute calculations.

```{r eval=FALSE}

> 10 + 20

[1] 30

```

```{r eval=FALSE}

> 20 / 10

[1] 2

```

If you are performing calculations in R, it's important to know that it follows the usual arithmetic convention of order of operations (remember [BIMDAS - Bracets, Indices, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction?](https://www.tes.com/en-ie/teaching-resource/bidmas-bodmas-bedmas-bimdas-pemdas-permdas-11154272#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20BIMDAS%20%2D%20Brackets%2C%20Indices%2C,Multiplication%2C%20Division%2C%20Addition%2C%20Subtraction)).

```{r eval = FALSE}


> (20 + 10 / 10) * 4 

[1] 84

> ((20 + 10) / 10) * 4

[1] 12

```

Now you'll have noticed that the output of every line of code we entered starts with a **`[1]`** before our actual result. What does this mean?

Think of the square brackets with a number as a way for R to label and organize its responses. Imagine you have a conversation with R, and every time you ask it something, it gives you an answer. The square brackets with a number, like **`[1]`**, are like labels on each response, telling you which answer corresponds to which question. This is R ***indexing*** its answer.

In each of the above examples, we asked R one question ***per each*** command, which is why the answer is always **`[1]`**. If we entered longer code with multiple questions, then we could multiple answers. We could tell which answer related to which question through the index. This is really useful when we ask R long and more complicated questions.

### Console Syntax (Aka "I'm Ron Burgundy?")

#### R Console and Typos

One of the most important concepts you need to understand when you are programming, is that you need to type exactly what you want R to do. If you make a mistake (e.g., a typo), R will not try and understand what you actually meant. For example, see what happens if you make the following mistake:

```{r eval=F}

> 10 = 20

```

```{r error = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

10 = 20

```

R thinks you making the claim that 10 equals 20. Since this is not true, R panics and refuses to run your command. Now any person looking at that code would guess that since `+` and `=` are on the same key on our keyboards, the person probably meant to type `10 + 20`. But we have a strong theory of mind whereas programming languages do not.

So be exact with your code or else be Ron Burgundy(?) [a Ron Burgundy situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3zfP14pLxc).

This type of mistakes are pretty benign, as R will tell us immediately that something is wrong. However, there can be a more silent type of mistake that can be more damaging. Let's image that you typed in `-` instead of `+` by mistake.

```{r eval= FALSE}

> 10 - 20

[1] -10

```

In this scenario, R will run this code and output the result. This is because the code still makes sense - it is perfectly legitimate to subtract 20 away from 10. R can't read your mind, so it sees three symbols in a perfectly logical order, and carries out the command. It assumes you're the adult here.

In short calculations like this, it will clear what you typed wrong. However, if you run a long-block of connected code and made a typo like this somewhere, the result you get be significantly different from the intended result. The main way to check for this is to always view the output of your code. If it looks significantly different from what you expected, then this type of silent error might be causing it.

#### R Console and Incomplete Commands

I have been pretty mean to the console, but there are rare times it will be a good Samaritan. For example, if R thinks you haven't finished a command it will print out `+` to allow you to finish it.

```{r eval = FALSE}

> (20 + 10
 
+ )

[1] 30

```

So when you see "+" in the console, this is R telling you that something is missing. If nothing is missing, then this indicates that your code might not be correctly formatted. Overall, the moral of this section can be summarized as: proofread your code!

Okay, that's a lot about using the console. Let's move on to other programming concepts.

## Data Types

Our overall goal for this course is to give you the ability to import your data into R, select a subset of the data most of interest for a given analysis, carry out an analysis to summarize these data and create visualizations of the data. But it's important to consider ***What is Data and how is it stored in R?***

Data comes in many forms: Numbers (Integers and decimal values) or alphabetical (characters or lines of text). R has developed a system for classifying this range of data into different data types. 


## Basic Data types in R

R has 4 basic data types that are used 99% of the time:

### Character

A character is anything wrapped inside quotation marks. It is often referred to as a *string*.

Strings can be anything inside single or double quotation marks.

```{r}

#we can use the class() function to check the data type of an object in R

class("a")

```

```{r}

class("cat")

```


Numbers in quotation marks are also recognized as a character type in R.


```{r}

class("3.14") #recognized as a character
class("2") #recognized as a character
class(2.13) #not recognised as a character

```


### Numeric (or Double)

In R, the numeric data type represents all real numbers, with or without decimal value, such as: 

```{r}

class(33)

class(33.33)

class(-1)

```

### Integer

An integer is any real whole number with no decimal points. We tell R to specify something as an integer by adding a capital "L" at the end. 

```{r}

class(33L)

class(-1L)

class(0L)

```
It might seem weird that R has a separate data type for integers when the numeric/double character type contains integers. Why bother with the separate data type? 

The reason is that integers store less space in your computers memory than the numeric or double data type. There's less information in "33" compared to "33.00". So if you have a very large dataset (in the millions), and you know for certain the data will only be integer, using the integer data type will save you a lot of storage space. 

It's unlikely that you will need to use integers over numeric/doubles for your own research, but its good to be aware of just in case.  

### Logical (otherwise know as Boolean)

The Logical Data type has two potential values: `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

In programming, we often need to deal with conditions and make decisions based on whether certain conditions are true or false. Did the student pass the exam? Is this p-value below `.05`?

The Logical data type in R enables us to represent and work with these truth values. 


```{r}


class(TRUE)

class(FALSE)

```

One thing to note is that it case sensitive, so typing in any of the following will produce errors. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

class(True)

Error: object 'True' not found

class(False)

Error: object 'False' not found

class(true)

Error: object 'true' not found

class(false)

Error: object 'false' not found

```


The main reason that there are different types of data in programming is that some commands can only be used on particular data types. For instance mathematical operations (+, -, x and /) are only meaningful for numbers.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
11.00 + 3.23 #will work

[1] 14.23


11 * 10 #will work

[1] 120

"11" + 3 # gives error

Error in "11" + 3 : non-numeric argument to binary operator

```

This is important to know when troubleshooting errors in R. It's not uncommon that when you download a data set online that a column that should be numeric is actually saved as a character (e.g., the person entering the data might have a mistake in the excel file). 

If you wanted to perform a statistical operation on that column (e.g., mean), you would first have to convert it to the numeric data type. You can do this by using the following function

```{r}

as.numeric("22")

```
The following functions enable you to convert one data type to another

```{r eval=FALSE}

as.character() #will convert data type to character

as.integer() #will convert to integer

as.logical() #will convert to logical

```

## Variables

The code we have been using so far has been single-use code. Once we have typed out code, there is nothing else we can do but look at their output. But programming languages enable us to store information to objects called ***variables***.

Variables are labels for pieces of information. If we want to use that information or recall later on, instead of running the same code that produced the information, we can just refer to its label. Let's say I have a character object that refers to my name. I can save that character object to a variable. 

```{r}

name <- "Ryan"

```

To create a variable, we first type the name of the variable (`name`). We use the assignment operator to tell R that we will be assigning (i.e., storing) information to`name`. This information is the string "Ryan". Once we run this code, then whenever R sees the variable`name` it will replace it with Ryan.

```{r}

print(name)

```

Now many of you who have seen my email will think *"Hold on a second, isn't your first name Brendan? You fraud!"*. Now before you grab your pitchforks, yes, you are technically correct. Thankfully, we are able to reassign our variable labels to new information.


```{r}

my_name <- "Brendan" #please don't call me this

print(name)

```

All data types can be stored as information to variables. 

```{r}

age <- 30L

height <- 175 #centimetre 

live_in_hot_country <- FALSE

print(age)

print(height)

print(live_in_hot_country)

```

```{r}


paste("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")


```
We can use variable names to compute calculations with their information or to print certain results.

We can also store data structures to variables. 

```{r}

class_names <- c("Ryan", "Gerry", "Eva", "Santi", "Molly", "Aoife")

print(class_names)

```

### What's in a name? (Conventions for Naming Variables)

There are hard and soft rules for naming variables that you should know.

**Hard Rules (Follow these, otherwise R won't create the variable for you)**

Variable names can only include upper case alphabetic characters A-Z, lower-case a-z, numeric characters 0-9, as well period `.` and underscores `_`.

Variables names must start with either a letter or a period (1st_name or \_1stname is wrong. first_name or .firstname is right)

Do not use spaces in variable names (`my name` is not okay. Use either `my_name` or \``my.name`)

Variable names are case sensitive (`my_name` is not the same as `My_name`)

Variable names cannot include special words that R reserves (e.g., if, else, repeat, while, function, for, in, TRUE, FALSE). You don't need to memories this, but it is worth remembering this if an error with your variable name comes up. After some time, you'll gain a strong intuition for what is a valid name and what is not.

**Soft Rules (you should follow these, otherwise your scripts and code will be messy)**

*Choose informative variable names that clearly describe the information they represent.* Someone should be able to look at your variable name and be able to reasonably guess what type of information it is storing. Variable names like "income", "grades", "height" are clear, whereas variables names like "money", "performance", or "cm" are ambiguous (e.g., what money - money received, spent, owed? performance on what? what was being measured in cm, height, width?). And for the love of God don't name your variables "variable1", "variable2", "variable3"!

*Choose short variable names whenever possible.* Concise names like `dob` or `iq` are better than `date_of_birth` or `intelligence_quotient`. It's much easier to work with shorter names as it avoids unnecessary and tedious typing thereby reducing the chance for making typos.

*But you should choose a long variable name that is clear over a short variable name that is unclear*. A long variable name like `total_exam_marks` is significantly better than a cryptic acronym like `tem`.

*Do not start your variables with a capital letter.* A standard convention in the R programming language is to use lowercase letters when naming variables or functions. So you could start your variable names with a capital letter, but it would look and sound strange to other R users [^03-programming_p1-1].

[^03-programming_p1-1]: This rule is the most arbitrary, but it does bear similarity with conventions in spoken languages. For example, German and English native-speakers tend to emphasize time at different points in a sentence. English speakers tend to specify the time at the end of the sentence "I will drive to Dublin on Friday", whereas German speakers tend to specify time near the beginning of the sentence "I will on Friday drive to Dublin " (Ich werde am Freitag nach Dublin fahren.). Of course, you could say it the German way in English, or the English way in German, but it would sound a bit unnatural.

*Use a conventional naming style and be consistent with it*. There are three conventional styles for handling variables that contain multiple words.

1.  The first style separates each word with an underscore (e.g., my**\_**age***,*** my**\_**name, my_height). This is called `Snake_case`.

2.  The second style separates each word with a period `.` (e.g., my.age, my.name, my.height).This is called `dot.notation`.

3.  The third style capitalizes every additional word after\*\* the first word (e.g., myAge, myName, myHeight). This is called `camelCase`.

I recommend that you use the `Snake_case` during this course, because it will keep your code consistent with my code. Additionally, this case is consistent with other programming languages, whereas `dot.notation` is not.

Outside of this course, feel free to pick whichever style you prefer. Just be consistent with it.



## Data Structures


So we've talked about the different types of data that we experience in the world and how R classifies them. We've also talked about how we can store this type of data into variables. But in data analysis, we rarely work with individual variables. Typically we work with large collections of variables that have a particular order. For example, data sets are organised by rows and columns 

This also holds true in R, which has several different types of ***data structures*** that organise and group together variables. Each data structure has specific rules and methods for creating or interacting with them. I'll briefly mention each data structure first, before we focus on two main data structures we'll use in this course: `vectors` and `data frames`. 

### Vectors

The most basic and (probably) important data structure in R are ***vectors***. You can think of vectors as a list of data of R that are of the same data type. 

For example, I could create a character vector with names of people in the class. 

```{r}

rintro_names <- c("Gerry", "Aoife", "Liam", "Eva", "Owen", "Ciara")


print(rintro_names)

```
```{r}

is.vector(rintro_names) 

```

And I can create a numeric vector with their performance on the module. 

```{r}

rintro_marks <- c(87, 91, 87, 90, 88, 89)

print(rintro_marks)

```

And I can create a logical vectors that describes whether or not they like R. 


```{r}

rintro_satisfied <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F, F, T) #you can use T or F as shortcuts

print(rintro_satisfied)

```

Technically, we have been using vectors the entire class. Vectors can have as little as 1 piece of data.

```{r}

instructor <- "Ryan/Brendan"

is.vector(instructor)

```
*Activity*: Try create a vector with only integers. Call it "int_vector". Check whether you have successfully created this vector with the code `class(int_vector)`

However, we can't include multiple data types in the one vector. Going back to our numeric grades vector, look what happens when we try mix in grades as characters. 

```{r}

rintro_marks <- c(87, "A1", 87, 90, 88, 89)


print(rintro_marks)
```
R has converted every element within the `rintro_marks` vector into a character. If R sees an object that is a vector, but sees that its elements belong to different data types, it will try and convert every element to one data type. This is a strict rule in R - a vector can only be created if ever single element (i.e., thing) inside that vector is of the same data type. 

If we were to check the class of the `rintro_marks`, it will show us this conversion

```{r}

rintro_marks <- c(87, 91, 87, 90, 88, 89) #original numeric vector


class(rintro_marks)


rintro_marks <- c(87, "A1", 87, 90, 88, 89)


class(rintro_marks)

```

Remember how I mentioned that you might download a dataset with a column that has numeric data, but is actually recognized as characters in R? This is one scenario where that could happen. The person entering the data might have accidentally entered text into a cell within a data column. When reads this column, it sees the text, and then R converts the entire column into characters. 

#### Working with Vectors 

We can perform several types of operations on vectors to gain useful information. 

**Numeric and Integer Vectors**

We can run functions on vectors. For example, we can run functions like `mean()`, `median`, or `sd()` to calculate descriptive statistics on numeric or integer-based vectors. 

```{r}

rintro_marks <- c(87, 91, 87, 90, 88, 89) #original numeric vector

mean(rintro_marks)

median(rintro_marks)

sd(rintro_marks)

```
A useful feature is that I can sort my numeric and integer vectors based on their scores. 

```{r}

sort(rintro_marks) #this will take the original vector and arrange from lowest to highest scores



```
The `sort()` function by default arranges from lowest to highest, but we can also tell it to arrange from highest to lowest. 

```{r}

sort(rintro_marks, decreasing = TRUE) 

```

**Character and Logical Vectors**

We are more limited when it comes to operators with character and logical vectors. But we can use functions like `summary()` to describe properties of character or logical vectors. 


```{r}


summary(rintro_names)




```
The `summary()` functions tells me how many elements are in the character vector (there are six names), whereas it gives me a breakdown of results for the logical vector. 



#### Vector Indexing and Subsetting

A vector in R is like a list of items. To be more specifc, vectors in R are actually *ordered* list of items. Each item in that list will have a position (known as its index). When you create that list (i.e., vector), the order in which you input the items (elements) determines its position (index). So the first item is at index 1, the second at index 2, and so on. Think of it like numbering items in a shopping list. 





```{r fig.cap = "Indexing for Numeric Vector", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


library(knitr)

include_graphics("img/03-index_numeric.png")

```


```{r fig.cap = "Indexing for Character Vector", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


library(knitr)

include_graphics("img/03-index-character.png")

```



```{r fig.cap = "Indexing for Logical Vector", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(knitr)

include_graphics("img/03-index-logical.png")


```

This property in vectors mean we are capable of extracting specific items from a vector based on their position. If I wanted to extract the first item in my list, I can do this by using `[]` brackets. 

```{r}

rintro_names[1]

```
Similarly, I could extract the 3rd element.

```{r}

rintro_marks[3]

```
Or I could extract the last element.

```{r}

rintro_satisfied[8]

```

This process is called subsetting. I am taking an original vector and taking a sub-portion of its original elements. 

I can ask R even to subset several elements from my vector based on their position. Let's say I want to subset the 2nd, 4th, and 8th elements. I just need to use `c()` to tell R that I am subsetting several elements.

```{r}

rintro_names[c(2, 4, 8)]

```
```{r}

rintro_marks[c(2, 4, 8)]

```

```{r}

rintro_satisfied[c(2, 4, 8)]

```
If the elements you are positioned right next to each other on a vector, you can use `:` as a shortcut. 

```{r}

rintro_names[c(1:4)] #this will extract the elements in index 1, 2, 3, 4

```

It's important to know however that when you perform an operation on a vector or you subset it, it does not actually change the original vector. For example, if you wanted to save the top three `rintro_marks`, the following code would not work:

```{r warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

sort(rintro_marks, decreasing = TRUE)


[1] 91 90 89 88 87 87

rintro_marks[c(1, 2, 3)]

[1] 87 91 87

print(rintro_marks)

[1] 87 91 87 90 88 89

```

You can see that neither the `sort()` function or subsetting actually changed the original vector. They just outputted a result to the R console. If I wanted to actually save their results, then I would need to assign them to a variable label. 

Here's how I would extract and save the top three exam marks. 

```{r}

marks_sorted <- sort(rintro_marks, decreasing = TRUE)

marks_top <- marks_sorted[c(1:3)]

print(marks_top)

```
Your turn: How could I extract the bottom 3 results? Give it a go.
